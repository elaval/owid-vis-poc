# A Javascript tool for building visualizations with data from Our World in Data 
## A Proof of concept

Our World in Data (OWID) is an initiative that aims at **research and data to make progress against the worldâ€™s largest problems**.  They collect and mantain hundreds of datasets from worlwide public data that is transformed into meaningful information via evidence based articles and data visualisations.

They currently have a visualization tool - OWID Grapher (https://github.com/owid/owid-grapher) - that has been designed to easily create, and publish, visualizations in a consistent format for different datasets.

But Grapher authors mention that

> "This repo is currently not well-designed for reuse as a visualization library, nor for reproducing the full production environment we have at Our World in Data, as our tools are tightly coupled with our database structure."

My objective with **owid-vis-pc** is to explore an alterantive approach for creating a suite of visualization components that would:
* Allow for easy reutilization (a javascrip library that can be easily applied to projects)
* Decouple the visualization tools from the database
* Be designed specially for OWID data (mainy data that has year / entity dimensions and numeric values)
* Be simple to understand and easily expanded vi visualization developers

## Quick overview

My idea is that we would develop a javascript library that will be easily distributed by standard channels (e.g. nmp @elaval/owid-vis-poc) and when imported in a javascript project it can be used as easily as:

<pre>

  // Let's assume thet we have already retreived the data for a specific varaible
  const data = [
    {entityName: "United Kingdom", year: 1990, value:73.2},
    ...
  ]

  const chartEL = owidVis.lineChart(data).unit("years").node():
  document.getElementById("owidChart").appendChild(chartEL);
  
  &lt;div id="owidChart">&lt;/div>

</pre>

You can see this in action in a html page with pure Javascript at [https://elaval.github.io/owid-vis-demo-basic/index.html](https://elaval.github.io/owid-vis-demo-basic/index.html)

And you can access a notebook that exemplifies how to retreive OWID data and render trend & barcharts in Observable.com at:

## Library architecture

### Data structure
 We will assume that the visualization library will consume datasets with a standard format (but the library itself will not be responsible for retreiving / producing the data).  *Below we give an overview on OWID data model*.

The assumption is that all data will have records with, at least, **entitiName**, **year** and **value**
<img width="462" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68602/193715399-22af89ec-572e-4cbd-a887-9872beaf4108.png">

Also the data will have a "unit" description that can should be part of the respective dataset metadata.

### Library classes
The visualization library will export an object - **owidVIS** - that will provide a collection of chart building functions. For example:

* **OWIDTrendChart**: Creates a line chart with entities values over years
* **OWIDBarChart**: Creates a bar chart with entities values for a specific year
* **OWIDMap**: Creates a world map with entities (countries) values for a specific year
...

Note: This POC illustrates the concept with TrendChart and BarChart classes

In the source code all visualization are Javascript (actually TypeScript) classes that are derived from a parent **OWIDChart** class which provides elements and functions that are common to all visualizations.

Visualizations are represented as visual elements on the DOM which include a \<div> wrapper that contains a \<svg> element which alos contains a \<g> element that will be the main container for all elements that are especific to each chart (e.g. lines for TrendChart, rectangles for BarChart, ...)

Most of the visual elements are created, configured and transformed using D3js (https://d3js.org/) which has became the de-facto library for data visualization.

Each Visualization class provides a series of methods that allow the user to provide specific configuration.  

For example, to create a trendChart that has "years" as the unit and a total width of 1000 pixels, we would use:
<pre>
const myTrendChart = owidVis.OWIDTrendChart(data).unit("years").width(1000)
</pre>

The *node()* method will export the DOM element (\<div>) that can be embedded in a html document.
  
 owidVis.OWIDTrendChart(data).node()


## Characteristics of OWID data

Current OWID Grappher consumes data from a MySQL database that is publicly distributed.  When we look at the data model, we can identify some key concepts 


![owid data model](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68602/193713247-772bf1d0-1610-4d5b-ad0a-8703cc15493d.png)


* Datasets: are associated to a specific source and can contain a collection of *variables* (metrics)
* Tags: descriptors that are associates to **datasets** (e.g. "Population Growth").  Tags can have tag parents which allows to build a hierarchical structure of tags (e.g. "Population Growth" is a child of "Population Growth & Vital Statistics")
* Variables: multiple variables can be associated to a **dataset**.  Each variable (e.g. "Fertility Rate") has a unit (e.g. "children per woman") and is associated to a table contains a collection of **data-values** that links values with time (year) and entities (countries, continents, ...).
* Entities have a name (e.g. "United Kingdom") and id (e.g. 1) and a code (e.g. GBR)

Once the user has selected a domain and dataset (e.g. "World Development Indicators - Economic Policy & Debt") and a specific variable from that dataset  (e.g. "GDP per capita, PPP (constant 2011 international $)") then we are dealing with data values that can be exemplefied by the following table:


The key dimensions for our visualization purposes are
* **entity name** (categorical)
* **year** (ordinal / time) 

And we have a numeric variable ("**value**") with ranges, units and format that will depend on the specific variable (%, people, $, ...)

The most common messages that we would like to communicate in our visualizations are:

- Trends:  how the metric evolves on time for a specific entity, and how the trend from different entities can be compared (line charts)
- Rankings: the relative size and order of the metrics for different entities (bar charts)
- Geography: how is the relative size of the metric distributed in the world (maps)
