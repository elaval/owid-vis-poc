# POC for modularizing OWID chart components

Our World in Data (OWID) is an initiative that aims at **research and data to make progress against the worldâ€™s largest problems**.  They collect and mantain hundreds of datasets from worlwide public data that is transformed into meaningful information via evidence based articles and data visualisations.

They currently have a powerful visualization tool - OWID Grapher - that has been designed to easily create, and publish, visualization information on top of new datasets.  The tool is great, but it is tightly coupled to the backend (Mysql queries to retreive data, within a React website).

This repository is a POC with some initial ideas to think about alternative ways to architect and decouple the visualization, page and data components.

## Step 1 - decouple data from frontend code
Instead of making direct queries to the database (via SQL) as an core part of the visualization code, we can decouple the data fro the presentation layer.

Data can be retreived in a flexible way via APIS (or standalone Parquet datafiles) that could be retreived and managed via Javascript on the client.

OWID currently provide easy access to data & metadata via api calls such as:

https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/data/variables/metadata/${variableId}.json

https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/data/variables/data/${variableId}.json

Data is organized on hundreds of datasets identified by a variable Id (e.g. 1454)

## Step 2 - modular visualization components
Instead of a visualization tool that is tightly coupled to a specific front-end architecture and technology, it is possible to build a library of reusable components that are specifically tailored to the type of visualization and data that OWID wants to make accesible.

If we have a sound architectural foundation, OWID vis components could be cretaed by a core team at OWID but highly enriched by an open source community.  These tools could be available for developers (and projects) distributed around the world to easily access and present "data stories".

This repository is an extremely basic POC of this concept.  We create a visualization componnet that can be distributed as a javascript package (technically an npm package) that could be reused in Javascript code or in platforms such as observable explorer.

Here you can access a very basic demo (a plain html file stored in a file storage service) that loads the visualization component, retreived the data from OWID Backend and renders a trend chart.

The following link shows how this component can be reused in www.observablehq.com.  This opens the door for using OWID component in platforms that are flexible for quick exploration and publication of data:

## Future steps - bring the queries to the client
With the posibility to have compact information stored in formats such as Parquet and lightweight databases that can be managed directly on the browser (such as DuckDB), it is possible to rethink the role of the backend and fronent in relation to datamanagement.

With datasets that are relatively stable (many with yearly updates), it is possibe to distribute the data as single or grouped datasets with no server code (e.g. blob storage / distribution services or even public access github repositories) and build certain level of data management directly on the client (meaning the users web browser). This is an avenue worth exploring.

## Aim - focus data visualization efforts on communication and user experience, not on web page development 
When we work on datavisualization we can spend an important amount of time on details that help the user to better understand the data (and the stories hidden in the data).  This should be an important focus for data visualization.

An important amount of time for quicly exploring data patterns, anomalies, differences and similarities ... for teams to "explore" the data. And then, once we understand the key aspects of a specific info domain, polish the presentation in order to be able to communicate the important messages, to focus on the right content (and not on fancy distractor).

If we get the right architecture (and tools) the effort can be concenbtrated on the important topics that add value.
